**Summary**

This project implements the use of JavaScript to create a popup block that edits the name and job of the card. Clicking the save button changes the user's information and is displayed on the page. The popup closes when user clicks the close button. There is also an add card button that creates a new card on the screen when properly filled in. There are input validation functions in the fields of both the Edit Modal and the Add Card Modal. As well as a beautiful Image Modal that pops up when the images of each card are clicked.
