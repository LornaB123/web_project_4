**Summary**

This project implements the use of JavaScript to create a popup block that edits the name and job of the card.
=======
**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!
